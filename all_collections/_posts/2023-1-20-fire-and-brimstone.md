One criticism made of Christianity is there is no Hell in the Old Testament. The problem with this is that it is Jesus who was the first Fire and Brimstone Preacher, and from whom the doctrine of Hell comes from. This misconception arises because the modern Church has been promoting an Humanistic Jesus. The NKJV removes the word damnation one hundred percent of the time thereby erasing the real Jesus' message of salvation and damnation. This is is why it is important to be KJV-only. The post victorian epoch is an aeon of total corruption. All central authority and theology from this aeon are corrupt (i.e. dispensationalism). You should feed your mind with writings from the pre-victorian aeon (i.e. replacement theology).
