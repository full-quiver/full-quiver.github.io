Emperor Constantine institutionalized a church of Christos embodying powerful, longstanding principles of Indo-European 
societies:

- Conflict is inherent throughout the natural and social world.
- Competition is basic to human nature, and war--competition writ large--is therefore normal and inevitable.
- Loyalty to one's leader is the highest virtue
- Fighting is the greatest occupation; glory is to be won on the battlefield; and the death in battle takes one into heaven
