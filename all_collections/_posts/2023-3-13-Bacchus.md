Livy indicates that the Bacchic cult had come to Rome from Etruria and then spread “like an epidemic.” It was, he claims, a wild and licentious affair that involved nocturnal sex rituals and ceremonial murder. Livy states that Bacchic meetings occurred at night under the cloak of darkness. They began with gluttonous banquets where the wine—Bacchus’s drink—flowed freely and the sexes mingled promiscuously so that “all sorts of corruption began to be practiced, since each person had ready to hand the chance of gratifying the particular desire to which he was naturally inclined.”

But it was not all fun and games. The evening events, Livy claims, would lead to “wholesale murders” that were concealed from public knowledge by the loud revelries: “No cries for help could be heard against the shriekings, the banging of drums, and the clashing of cymbals in the scene of debauchery and bloodshed.”

It was through the testimony of an eyewitness that the Roman senate came to be alerted to these dangerous rites. Under threat of punishment the witness revealed that new inductees in the cult were always under the age of twenty. One of them would be introduced to the cult priests as “a kind of sacrificial victim.” This hapless youth would then be taken into the midst of the frenzied Bacchics, who were shouting, singing, clashing cymbals, and beating drums to cover over the ultimate cultic act: ceremonial rape. Moreover, “anyone refusing to submit to outrage or reluctant to commit crimes was slaughtered as a sacrificial victim.”
